  Socket function calls are always made with ports and addresses in a Big-endian
  format also known as network byte order. Because the endianess of host bytes may
  vary depending on the host software and hardware, unlike [`arpa/inet/ntohs`], the htons function is used to ensure
  that a short being provided to the socket functions is Big-endian irrespective of the native
  endianess of the host.
