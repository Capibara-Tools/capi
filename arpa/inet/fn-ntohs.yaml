    description: "A short in network byte order."

  Socket function calls are always made with ports and addresses in a Big-endian
  format also known as network byte order. Because the endianess of host bytes may
  vary depending on the host software and hardware, the ntohs function is used to ensure
  that shorts in network byte order can have their value represented natively irrespective 
  of the native endianess of the host.
