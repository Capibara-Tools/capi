    description: "A long in host byte order."

  Socket function calls are always made with ports and addresses in a Big-endian
  format also known as network byte order. Because the endianess of host bytes may
  vary depending on the host software and hardware, the htonl function is used to ensure
  that a long being provided to the socket functions is Big-endian irrespective of the native
  endianess of the host.
