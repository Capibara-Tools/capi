  Used for version comparison semantics. This enum type is rarely referenced directly and
  actually has 3 type definitions: [`winsock2/WSAECOMPARATOR`], *[`winsock2/PWSAECOMPARATOR`],
  *[`winsock2/LPWSAECOMPARATOR`]. It's also indirectly a member of the struct, [`winsock2/_WSAVersion`]
  by means of type definition.
