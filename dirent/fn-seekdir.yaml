summary: "Sets the position of a given opened directory stream."
returns:
  type: "void"
  description: "Function does not return."
parameters:
  - name: "directory"
    type: "[`dirent/DIR`] *"
    description: "A pointer to the DIR object of the stream whose location will be set."
  - name: "location"
    type: "long int"
    description: "A long integer representing a location in the stream."
description: |
  This function sets the directory stream pointer location for a given directory stream pointer. The value passed into location
  should be obtained through a call to [`dirent/telldir`]. Attempting to call [`dirent/readdir`] after calling [`dirent/seekdir`]
  is undefined however, if the stream pointer is rewound via a call to [`dirent/rewinddir`] as this function will re-index the
  directory invalidating any previously known stream locations. Likewise passing in an arbitrary value not obtained from telldir
  will also cause undefined behavior. No errors are defined.
