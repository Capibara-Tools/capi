description: |
  This function rewinds a directory stream pointer to its first entry as though it had just been opened. 
  It will also update the directory stream to the current state of the corresponding directory i.e.
  it will reflect changes to files in the directory. 
  
  Note: If the program calls [`unistd/fork`] then the child or parent process may continue interacting
  with the directory but not both.
