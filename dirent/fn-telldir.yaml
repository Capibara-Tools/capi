  This function gets the directory stream pointer location for a given directory stream pointer. The value is intended to be used
  with the location parameter of [`dirent/seekdir`]. Attempting to call [`dirent/readdir`] after calling [`dirent/seekdir`] with a
  a location retrieved from this function is undefined however, if the stream pointer is rewound via a call to [`dirent/rewinddir`] after
  this function is called and before the [`dirent/seekdir`] function is called. This is because [`dirent/rewinddir`] will re-index the
  current directory invalidating any previously known stream locations. No errors are defined.
