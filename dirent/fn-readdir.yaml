  This function retrieves the next entry from an open given directory stream. Upon opening a
  directory the stream pointer is positioned at the first entry. The function is meant to be
  called repeatedly to iterate through all the entries, If called again after exhausting all
  the entries, the function will then return null without setting errno. In the event of an
  error null will also returned and errno will be set.

  Entries '..' and '.' may or may not be available depending on if they are defined for the
  directory in question.

  NOTE: This function uses static memory and as such the returned pointer should not be freed.
