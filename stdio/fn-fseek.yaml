description: |
  The function sets the file cursor to a given position based on the addition of an offset and an offset_origin. The offset_origin
  may be the start of a file given by [`stdio/SEEK_SET`], the current position given by [`stdio/SEEK_CUR`], or the end of a file given by
  [`stdio/SEEK_END`]. The function returns 0 upon success and a non-zero value upon failure.
