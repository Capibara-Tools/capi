summary: "A negative sentinel value, used to indicate the end of a file has been reached."
kind: !object
description: |
  This value is typically returned when there is no other data to return because the file cursor
  is at the end of the file. That said, some functions may also return it when there is simply just
  some kind of read error rather than solely hitting the end of a file. Users should use
  the [`stdio/feof`] function in order to determine if a generic read error is actually caused
  by running into the end of a file or something else.
