description: |
  This function generates a unique a valid temporary filename that does not exist. If the output_buffer
  is a [`stdio/NULL`] pointer then the function will use an internal buffer that will be overwritten when
  the function is called again. If an output buffer is supplied it should be at least [`stdio/L_tmpnam`]
  characters long. The function will return either a pointer to the output_buffer or the internal buffer
  depending on whether an output buffer was supplied. If the function is not successful then the function
  will return [`stdio/NULL`]. Users may wish to check [`stdio/TMP_MAX`] to see how many unique file names
  this function is capable of generating.
