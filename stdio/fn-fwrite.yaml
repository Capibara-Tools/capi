summary: "Writes data to a given stream from an array pointed to by source."
returns:
  type: "[`stdio/size_t`]"
  description: "The total number of elements that were written."
parameters:
  - name: "source"
    type: "void *"
    description: "A pointer to an array of elements to be written."
  - name: "element_size"
    type: "[`stdio/size_t`]"
    description: "The size of an individual element to be written."
  - name: "number_of_elements"
    type: "[`stdio/size_t`]"
    description: "The number of elements of size, element_size, that should be written in total. Must not be larger than the number_of_elements in the array."
  - name: "stream"
    type: "[`stdio/FILE`] *"
    description: "A pointer to the FILE object referencing an output stream."
description: |
  The function writes up to number_of_elements elements of size, element_size, to stream.
  The function will return the total number of elements written and if this number
  disagrees with number_of_elements specified than an error has occurred. If element_size is set
  to 1, then number_of_elements is simply the number of bytes one wishes to write. The position in
  the file will be incremented by the number of bytes written.
