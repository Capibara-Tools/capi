  The function attempts to open the file specified by the filename string. There are six different modes
  by which a file may be accessed: 
  - 'r' opens a file for reading but it must exist.
  - 'w' creates an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name exists, that file will be erased.
  - 'a' opens a file and appends to it. The file will be created if it doesn't exist.
  - 'r+' opens a file for reading and writing but it must exist.
  - 'w+' creates an empty file for reading and writing. If a file with the same name exists, that file will be erased.
  - 'a+' opens a file for reading or appending. The file will be created if it doesn't exist.
  Users may also append a 'b' character to indicate they wish to open the file in a binary mode. This function
  returns a file pointer on success otherwise [`stdio/NULL`] is returned and the global errno is set.
