description: |
  An implementation defined unsigned integer. That can store the maximum size of a
  theoretically possible object of any type. Programs that use other types, such as
  unsigned int, for array indexing may fail on, e.g. 64-bit systems when the index
  exceeds UINT_MAX or if it relies on 32-bit modular arithmetic.
