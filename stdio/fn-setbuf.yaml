summary: "Sets the internal buffer for stream operations."
returns:
  type: "void"
  description: "Returns nothing."
parameters:
  - name: "stream"
    type: "[`stdio/FILE`] *"
    description: "A pointer to the FILE object of the stream upon which to set the buffer."
  - name: "buffer"
    type: "char *"
    description: "A pointer to the buffer object that will be used. Must be at least the size of [`stdio/BUFSIZE`]."
description: |
  This function sets the buffer for stream operations. The supplied buffer should be at least
  [`stdio/BUFSIZE`] characters long or it should be a [`stdio/NULL`] pointer. If the buffer is
  given, it will enable full buffering consistent with passing [`stdio/_IOFBF`] to [`stdio/setvbuf`]
  with a buffer size of [`stdio/BUFSIZE`]. Passing a [`stdio/NULL`] pointer will disable buffering
  for the given stream, consistent with with passing [`stdio/_IONBF`] to [`stdio/setvbuf`] with a
  buffer size of 0.

  For more options use [`stdio/setvbuf`].
