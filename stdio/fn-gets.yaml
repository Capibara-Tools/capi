  DEPRECATED SINCE C99. DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION AS IT CAN LEAD TO BUFFER OVERFLOW ERRORS.
  Users looking for alternatives should prefer [`stdio/fgets`] which enables a max buffersize.

  This function reads a line from [`stdio/stdin`]. It also advance the file stream
  position indicator. It will either read until it encounters a newline or [`stdio/EOF`].
  On success, the function will return a pointer to the output_buffer. On failure, 
  a null pointer is returned.
