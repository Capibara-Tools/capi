description: |
  This function reads the next unsigned char from a given stream. It will also advance the file stream
  position indicator. In order to return potential error values the result is cast to an int and the
  return result will either be the integer representation of the unsigned char on success or [`stdio/EOF`]
  on failure. Basically the same as [`stdio/getc`].
