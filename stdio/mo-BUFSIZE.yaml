summary: "An integer constant expression that is a suitable choice for the size argument to [`stdio/setvbuf`]."
kind: !object
description: |
  The value chosen for this constant is per implementation to the stream efficient. As such it's a
  good choice for the buffer size you use with [`stdio/setvbuf`]. Because the type is generally I/O optimized
  and guaranteed to be at leasr 256 bytes it's also commonly used as a generic buffer size used for unrelated
  tasks such as reading lines of input.
