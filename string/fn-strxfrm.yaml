description: |
  The strxfrm function is designed to operate exclusively on strings and as
  such it will terminate on the null character or maximum number of chars, 
  max_num_of_chars. This function converts up to maximum_num_of_chars characters
  into a given locale specified by the LC_COLLATE setting and writes them to the
  destination array. The function returns the size of the transformed string up to
  but not including the null-terminating character. NOTE: If the max_num_of_chars is 0,
  the pointer to the buffer, destination, can be null.
