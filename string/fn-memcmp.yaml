summary: "Compares a given number of bytes from one byte buffer against those of another byte buffer."
returns: "int"
parameters:
  - name: "string_1"
    type: "const void *"
    description: "A pointer to the first memory block."
  - name: "string_2"
    type: "const void *"
    description: "A pointer to the second memory block."
  - name: "num_of_bytes"
    type: "[`string/size_t`]"
    description: "The number of bytes from both blocks of memory that will be compared."
description: |
  This function operates on memory areas which means it can operate on any bytes rather 
  than just arrays of characters. The traditional use case assumes these areas contain strings, 
  or more correctly arrays of chars, but they don't necessarily have to. It compares a given
  number of bytes from two memory blocks. The function will return an integer less than,
  greater than, or equal to 0 respective to the possible states where string_1 is less than,
  greater than, or equal to string_2.
