summary: "Concatenates a source string onto the end of a destination string."
returns: "char *"
parameters:

    type: "char *"
    description: "A pointer to the destination string. Must be large enough to contain the resulting string."

  Note: [`string/strncat'] is a similar function that should generally be preferred
  because it has a character limit while strcat does not. This means strcat will more
  likely be vulnerable to overflow attacks if used without care. The strcat function is
  designed to operate exclusively on strings and as such it will terminate on the null
  character. This function concatenates a non-overlapping source string onto the end
  of the destination string. It also returns a pointer to the destination string.
