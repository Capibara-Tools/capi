description: |
  This function operates on memory areas which means it can operate on any bytes rather 
  than just arrays of characters. The traditional use case assumes these areas contain strings, 
  or more correctly arrays of chars, but they don't necessarily have to. It overwrites
  num_of_bytes bytes with a specified character, character, at the beginning of the memory
  block pointed to by the parameter, string. The function will return the pointer to the 
  memory block which was overwritten.
