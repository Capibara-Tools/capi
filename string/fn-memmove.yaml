  Note: The memmove function is the preferred safer alternative to [`string/memmcpy'] when
  used on overlapping memory blocks. However it is also slower if not dealing with overlapping blocks.
  The function operates on memory areas which means it can operate on any bytes rather than just
  arrays of characters. The traditional use case assumes these areas contain strings, or more
  correctly arrays of chars, but they don't necessarily have to. It copies a given number of
  bytes from a source memory area to a destination memory area. The function will return a 
  pointer to the destination.
