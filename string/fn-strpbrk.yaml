  The strpbrk function is designed to operate exclusively on strings and as such
  it will terminate on the null character. This function searches the string pointed
  to by the parameter, string, for the first character in the input string that is
  shared in common with the array of accepted characters, accepted_chars. If it finds
  a match it returns a pointer to the first matched character. Otherwise it returns NULL.
