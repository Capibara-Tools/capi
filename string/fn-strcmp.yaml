  Note: [`string/strncmp`] is a similar function whose usage is generally preferred because
  strcmp lacks a character limit that strncmp possesses. The strcmp function is designed
  to operate exclusively on strings and as such it will terminate on the null character. 
  This function compares the bytes from string_1 against those from string_2. The function will 
  return an integer less than, greater than, or equal to 0 respective to the possible states 
  where string_1 is less than, greater than, or equal to string_2.
