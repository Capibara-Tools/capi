summary: "Compares a given number of characters of one string against those of another string"
returns: "char *"
parameters:
  - name: "string_1"
    type: " const char *"
    description: "A pointer to the first string."
  - name: "string_2"
    type: "const char *"
    description: "A pointer to the second string."
  - name: "num_of_chars"
    type: "[`string/size_t`]"
    description: "The number of characters from both strings that will be compared."

  Note: [`string/strcmp`] is a similar function whose usage is discouraged because
  it lacks a character limit that strncmp possesses. The strncmp function is designed
  to operate exclusively on strings and as such it will terminate on the null character
  or character count rather than a character count exclusively. This function compares
  the first num_of_chars characters from string_1 against those from string_2. The function
  will return an integer less than, greater than, or equal to 0 respective to the possible
  states where string_1 is less than, greater than, or equal to string_2.
