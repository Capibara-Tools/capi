returns:
  type: "char *"
  description: "A pointer to the destination string."
parameters:
  - name: "dest"
    type: "char *"
    description: "A pointer to the destination array. Must be large enough to contain the source string."
  - name: "source"
    type: "const char *"
    description: "A pointer to the source string. The source must not overlap the destination."
  - name: "num_of_chars"
    type: "[`string/size_t`]"
    description: "The number of characters that will be copied from the source string to the destination."

  Note: [`string/strcpy`] is a similar function whose usage is discouraged because
  it lacks a character limit that strncpy possesses. The strncpy function is designed
  to operate exclusively on strings and as such it will terminate on the null character
  rather than on a character count exclusively. This function copies up to a given
  number of characters from a non-overlapping source string into the destination
  array. When the source length is less than the specified num_of_chars, the leftover
  difference will be filled with null bytes. It also returns a pointer to the
  destination string.
