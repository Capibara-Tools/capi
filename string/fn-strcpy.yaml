parameters:
  - name: "dest"
    type: "char *"
    description: "A pointer to the destination array. Must be large enough to contain the source string."
  - name: "source"
    type: "const char *"
    description: "A pointer to the source string. The source must not overlap the destination."

  Note: [`string/strncpy`] is a similar function whose usage is preferred because
  strcpy lacks a character limit that strncpy possesses. This means strcpy will more
  likely be vulnerable to overflow attacks if used without care. The strcpy function 
  is designed to operate exclusively on strings and as such it will terminate on the
  null character. This function copies the characters from a non-overlapping source
  string into the destination array. It also returns a pointer to the destination string.
