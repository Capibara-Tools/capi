  The strtok function is designed to operate exclusively on strings and as
  such it will terminate on the null character. This function splits the string
  into multiple tokens on a delimiter. The first on a given token should pass in the
  string to be tokenized and a delimiter. Subsequent calls to the same string need
  only pass NULL and a delimiter. The function accomplishes this by storing the location
  of the last input string in static memory, however it is as a result not threadsafe. The
  function returns a pointer to one token for each call. The initial input string has
  been exhausted when the function returns NULL.
