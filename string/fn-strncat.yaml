    type: "char *"
    description: "A pointer to the destination string. Must be large enough to contain the resulting string."
  - name: "source"
    type: "const char *"
    description: "A pointer to the source string. The source must not overlap the destination."
  - name: "num_of_chars"

  Note: [`string/strcat`] is a similar function whose usage is discouraged because
  it lacks a character limit that strncat possesses. The strncat function is designed
  to operate exclusively on strings and as such it will terminate on the null character
  or character count rather than a character count exclusively. This function concatenates
  the first num_of_chars characters from a non-overlapping source string onto the end of the 
  destination string. It also returns a pointer to the destination string.
