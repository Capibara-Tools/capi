summary: "Copies a given number of bytes from a source memory area to a destination memory area."
returns:
  type: "void *"
  description: "A pointer to the destination."
parameters:
  - name: "dest"
    type: "void *"
    description: "A pointer to the destination memory block."
  - name: "source"
    type: "const void *"
    description: "A pointer to the source memory block."
  - name: "num_of_bytes"
    type: "[`string/size_t`]"
    description: "The number of bytes which will be copied from the source to the destination."

  Note: [`string/memmove`] is a similar function which should be preferred in cases dealing
  with overlapping memory blocks. The memcpy function operates on memory areas which means
  it can operate on any bytes rather than just arrays of characters. The traditional use
  case assumes these areas contain strings, or more correctly arrays of chars, but they
  don't necessarily have to. It copies a given number of bytes from a source memory area
  to a destination memory area. The function will return a pointer to the destination.
