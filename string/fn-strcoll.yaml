  The strcoll function is designed to operate exclusively on strings and as such it will
  terminate on the null character. This function compares the bytes from string_1 against
  those from string_2. The weighting of the bytes is dependent upon the sorting order of
  the locale specified in the LC_COLLATE setting. The function will return an integer less
  than, greater than, or equal to 0 respective to the possible states where string_1 is less
  than, greater than, or equal to string_2.
