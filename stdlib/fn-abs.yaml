  Mathematically speaking, absolute value, is defined as the magnitude of a real number
  without regard to its sign. Therefore, this function will give the magnitude, that is
  positive representation, of both positive and negative integers. In other words:
  - if the given integer is -1, then 1 will be returned.
  - if the given integer is 0, then 0 will be returned.
  - if the given integer is 1, then 1 will be returned.

  This function returns the absolute value of the input.
