summary: "Takes the absolute value of a given integer."
returns:
  type: "int"
  description: "The absolute value of the input."

  Mathematically speaking, absolute value, is defined as the magnitude of a real number
  without regard to its sign. Therefore, this function will give the magnitude, that is
  positive representation, of both positive and negative integers. In other words:
  - if the given integer is -1, then 1 will be returned.
  - if the given integer is 0, then 0 will be returned.
  - if the given integer is 1, then 1 will be returned.

  This function returns the absolute value of the input.
examples: 
  - title: Take absolute value of -3
    code: |
      #include <stdio.h>
      #include <stdlib.h>

      int main(int argc, char ** argv){
        int x = -3;
        int result = abs(x);

        //This prints 'The absolute value of -3 is 3.'
        printf("The absolute value of %d is %d", x, result);
      }
